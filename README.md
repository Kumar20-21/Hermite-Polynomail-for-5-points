# Hermite-Polynomail-for-5-points
Hermite Polynomial of degree 4 and Max speed
The program takes 5 point grid and gives the following output:
1) The value of f(x) at the any point of Interval of interpolation.
2) The minimum value of x in the interpolating interval at which the value of f(x)=80.667
3) The value of x at which f(x) has a maxima and the maximum value of f(x).
